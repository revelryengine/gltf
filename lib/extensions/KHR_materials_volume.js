* @property {Number} [thicknessFactor=0] - The thickness of the volume beneath the surface. The value is given in the coordinate space of the mesh. If the value is 0 the material is thin-walled. Otherwise the material is a volume boundary. The doubleSided property has no effect on volume boundaries.
* @property {textureInfo} [thicknessTexture] - A texture that defines the thickness, stored in the G channel. This will be multiplied by thicknessFactor.
* @property {Number} [attenuationDistance=Infinity] - Density of the medium given as the average distance that light travels in the medium before interacting with a particle. The value is given in world space.
* @property {Number[]} [attenuationColor=[1,1,1]] - The color that white light turns into due to absorption when reaching the attenuation distance.
